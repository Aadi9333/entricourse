    <h2>About Telugu Language</h2>
    <p>The following is the information about telugu language</p>
    <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telugu_language">In the precolonial era, Telugu became the language of high culture across South India.[42] Vijaya Ramaswamy compared it to the overwhelming dominance of French as the cultural language of modern Europe during roughly the same era.[41] Telugu also predominates in the evolution of Carnatic music, one of two main subgenres of Indian classical music and is widely taught in music colleges focusing on Carnatic tradition.[45] Various non-Telugu people over the centuries have remarked on the natural musicality of Telugu speech, referring to it as a mellifluous and euphonious language.[44][46][47]</blockquote>
